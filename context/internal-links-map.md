## Internal Linking Best Practices

When adding internal links to blog content:

1. **Link Naturally**: Only link when genuinely relevant and helpful to the reader
2. **Vary Anchor Text**: Use different phrases for the same destination URL
3. **3-5 Links Per Post**: Aim for 3-5 strategic internal links in each blog post
4. **Deep Linking**: Link to specific relevant pages, not just the homepage
5. **Early Links Matter**: Links in the first few paragraphs carry more weight
6. **Update This Map**: Add new pages as you create them, remove outdated URLs
