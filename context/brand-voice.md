## Writing Style Guidelines

### Sentence Structure
- **Vary length**: Mix short, direct sentences with longer explanatory ones for readability
- **Active voice preferred**: "We identify vulnerabilities" not "Vulnerabilities are identified"
- **Average length**: 15-20 words per sentence
- **Clarity first**: If a sentence requires re-reading, rewrite it. Security content must be immediately clear.
- **No emdashes**: Never use emdashes (—) or double hyphens (--) in sentences

### Paragraph Structure
- **Length**: 2-4 sentences typically
- **One idea per paragraph**: Each paragraph should focus on a single security concept or point
- **Transitions**: Use clear logical connectors between security concepts
- **White space**: Break up technical content with frequent paragraph breaks for scannability

### Word Choice
- **Precise**: Use specific security terminology when accurate, but define technical terms
- **Concrete**: "$5,000-$15,000 for SMB pentesting" not "affordable security"
- **Action-oriented**: "Identify", "Remediate", "Secure", "Protect", "Assess"
- **Avoid fluff**: Cut "very", "really", "actually", "kind of", "sort of" unless essential
- **No absolutes**: Avoid "unhackable", "100% secure", "guaranteed protection"

### Terminology

**Say This** → **Not That**
- cybersecurity → cyber security / cyber-security (use single word)
- penetration testing → ethical hacking (pentesting is industry standard)
- vulnerability → bug (vulnerability is more precise)
- remediation → fix (remediation is more professional)
- threat actor → hacker (threat actor is more accurate)
- attack surface → footprint (attack surface is standard terminology)
- security assessment → security scan (assessment implies thoroughness)
- compliance framework → compliance requirement (framework is more accurate)

## Content Formatting

### Headlines
- **Be specific**: "Penetration Testing Cost for Small Business" not "Security Testing Pricing"
- **Include benefit or answer**: Tell reader what they'll learn or gain
- **Use numbers**: "5 Things Included in a Penetration Test" or "Complete SOC 2 Guide"
- **Keep concise**: 50-60 characters for SEO optimization

### Subheadings
- **Descriptive**: Should make sense independently ("What's Included in a Pentest")
- **Scannable**: Readers should understand content flow from headings alone
- **Keyword-rich**: Include target keywords naturally
- **Question-based**: Use 2-3 H2s as buyer questions ("How much does pentesting cost?")

### Lists
- **Use for steps**: Numbered lists for sequential processes
- **Use for features**: Bulleted lists for non-sequential items
- **Keep parallel**: All items start with verbs or all are complete sentences
- **Scannable**: Break complex security information into digestible chunks

### Calls-to-Action
- **Clear action**: "Schedule a consultation" not "Learn more"
- **Value-focused**: "Get a clear pentest report with prioritized fixes"
- **Credibility cue**: "Designed for startups and compliance teams"
- **Natural placement**: CTAs should flow logically with content
