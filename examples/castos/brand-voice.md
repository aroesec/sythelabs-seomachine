## Writing Style Guidelines

### Sentence Structure
- **Vary length**: Mix short punchy sentences with longer explanatory ones
- **Active voice preferred**: "Castos helps you grow" not "Growth is helped by Castos"
- **Average length**: 15-20 words per sentence
- **Clarity first**: If a sentence is confusing, rewrite it
- **Avoid emdashes**: Don't use emdashes (—) or double hyphens (--) in sentences

### Paragraph Structure
- **Length**: 2-4 sentences typically
- **One idea per paragraph**: Focus each paragraph on a single point
- **Transitions**: Connect paragraphs logically
- **White space**: Break up long blocks of text

### Word Choice
- **Conversational**: Write how you'd speak to a colleague
- **Specific**: "Increase downloads by 40%" not "Improve performance"
- **Active verbs**: "Launch", "Create", "Grow", "Build", "Optimize"
- **Avoid fluff**: Cut "very", "really", "actually" unless needed for emphasis

### Terminology

**Say This** → **Not That**
- Podcast hosting → Podcast storage (hosting is industry standard)
- Analytics → Stats (analytics sounds more professional)
- RSS feed → Podcast feed (RSS for technical accuracy when needed)
- Listener → Subscriber (listener is more accurate)
- Episode → Show (episode is the unit, show is the series)

## Content Formatting

### Headlines
- **Be specific**: "How to Grow Your Podcast Audience in 2025" not "Podcast Growth Tips"
- **Include benefit**: Tell reader what they'll gain
- **Use numbers**: "7 Ways..." or "Complete Guide..."
- **Keep concise**: 60 characters or less for SEO

### Subheadings
- **Descriptive**: Should make sense on their own
- **Scannable**: Readers should grasp content flow from headings alone
- **Keyword-rich**: Include target keywords naturally
- **Parallel structure**: Use consistent format within article

### Lists
- **Use for sequential steps**: Numbered lists for processes
- **Use for multiple items**: Bulleted lists for non-sequential points
- **Keep consistent**: Parallel structure (all start with verbs, all complete sentences, etc.)
- **Scannable**: Break complex information into digestible chunks

### Calls-to-Action
- **Clear action**: "Start your free trial" not "Learn more"
- **Value-focused**: Tell them what they'll get
- **Appropriate timing**: Match intensity to funnel stage
- **Natural placement**: CTAs should flow with content

## Voice Examples

### Excellent Castos Voice ✅

"A lot of people think creating a podcast is too complicated for them – it seems like a lot of work, you need a lot of equipment, time and even getting the right guests on seems like a lot of effort. 

Or sometimes, they think that it’s way too simple to be taken seriously as a business or marketing channel. 

But we’ve helped thousands of people start podcasts, and here’s what we’ve learned: 

This misconception keeps thousands of experts, entrepreneurs, and passionate individuals from sharing their knowledge and building audiences. "

**Why this works**:
- Acknowledges reader's pain point
- Conversational and approachable
- Promises practical, actionable value
- Sets clear expectations
- Uses active, direct language

### Not Castos Voice ❌

"Podcast analytics represent a comprehensive suite of metrics available to content creators for evaluating performance across multiple dimensions of listener engagement and content efficacy.

At Castos, we provide industry-leading analytics capabilities that enable sophisticated analysis of podcast performance through our proprietary dashboard interface.

Click here to learn more about our analytics features."

**Why this fails**:
- Overly formal and corporate
- Features-focused instead of benefit-focused
- Doesn't acknowledge creator needs
- Generic CTA with no value proposition
- Reads like marketing copy, not helpful content
