## 1. Primary keyword instance map

**Target density**: 1-2% (for ~2,800 word article body, that means 14-28 uses of the three-word phrase at 1%, or roughly 4-8 exact-match instances to stay natural while hitting density with variations)

### Exact-match instances of "ClawdBot security risks" (body only, excluding frontmatter)

| # | Location | Line | Context |
|---|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | **H1 headline** | 19 | "ClawdBot security risks: What every organization needs to know" |
| 2 | **Intro paragraph 2** (first 100 words) | 23 | "The ClawdBot security risks span critical CVEs, supply chain attacks..." |
| 3 | **H2 heading** | 53 | "What are the ClawdBot security risks?" |
| 4 | **H2 heading** | 144 | "How to protect your organization from ClawdBot security risks" |

**Total exact-match instances in body**: 4

### Partial-match / variation instances of "ClawdBot" + "security" or "risk"

| # | Location | Line | Variation |
|---|----------|------|-----------|
| 5 | Key takeaways (conclusion) | 210 | "ClawdBot represents a new category of cybersecurity risk" |
| 6 | Enterprise section | 136 | "OpenClaw as carrying 'unacceptable cybersecurity risk'" |

### Density calculation

- **Estimated total article body word count**: ~2,800 words
- **Exact-match "ClawdBot security risks"**: 4 instances x 3 words = 12 keyword words
- **Keyword density (exact match)**: 12 / 2,800 = ~0.43%
- **Including close variations** (ClawdBot + security/risk in same sentence): 6 instances
- **Effective keyword density with variations**: ~0.64%

**VERDICT**: BELOW TARGET. Current density of 0.43% exact-match falls below the 1% target. Even with variations, effective density is only ~0.64%. Needs 2-4 more strategic placements.

## 2. Critical placement audit

| Placement Location | Required | Present | Details |
|---|---|---|---|
| **H1 headline** | Yes | YES | Line 19: "ClawdBot security risks: What every organization needs to know" |
| **First 100 words** | Yes | YES | Line 23: "The ClawdBot security risks span critical CVEs..." (appears within first ~80 words of body) |
| **H2 subheadings (2-3)** | Yes | YES (2 of target 2-3) | Line 53: "What are the ClawdBot security risks?" and Line 144: "How to protect your organization from ClawdBot security risks" |
| **Conclusion/last paragraph** | Yes | PARTIAL | Line 210: Uses "cybersecurity risk" but not the exact primary keyword phrase "ClawdBot security risks" |
| **Meta title** | Yes | YES | "ClawdBot Security Risks: What Users Need to Know" |
| **Meta description** | Yes | YES | "ClawdBot has critical security risks including RCE vulnerabilities..." |
| **URL slug** | Yes | YES | /blog/clawdbot-security-risks |

### Gaps identified

1. **Conclusion**: The key takeaways section (line 210) uses "cybersecurity risk" instead of the exact primary keyword "ClawdBot security risks." This is the most critical gap.
2. **H2 headings**: Only 2 of the 7 H2s contain the primary keyword. A third H2 with a keyword variation would strengthen topical signals.
3. **Mid-article reinforcement**: The entire middle of the article (sections on supply chain attack, database breach, and enterprise bans from lines 104-142) contains zero instances of the exact primary keyword phrase.

## 3. Secondary keyword distribution

### "OpenClaw security" (exact match)

| # | Location | Line | Present |
|---|----------|------|---------|
| - | - | - | **NOT FOUND in body text** |

**Assessment**: MISSING. "OpenClaw" appears 11 times and "security" appears throughout, but the exact phrase "OpenClaw security" never appears in the article body. This is a significant gap since users searching for the rebranded name need to find this article.

### "ClawdBot vulnerabilities" (exact match)

| # | Location | Line | Present |
|---|----------|------|---------|
| - | - | - | **NOT FOUND in body text** |

**Assessment**: MISSING. "ClawdBot" and "vulnerabilities" both appear frequently but never as the combined phrase "ClawdBot vulnerabilities." The H3 heading on line 73 says "Remote code execution vulnerabilities" without "ClawdBot." This is a significant missed opportunity for a high-intent search query.

### "is ClawdBot safe" (exact/near match)

| # | Location | Line | Present |
|---|----------|------|---------|
| 1 | FAQ H3 heading | 192 | "Is ClawdBot safe to use?" |

**Assessment**: PRESENT (1 instance). The FAQ heading captures this query well. However, the answer paragraph on line 194 does not repeat the phrase. A single instance is adequate for a long-tail question keyword, but reinforcing it in the answer text would strengthen the featured snippet opportunity.

### "agentic AI security risks" (exact match)

| # | Location | Line | Present |
|---|----------|------|---------|
| - | - | - | **NOT FOUND as exact phrase in body text** |

**Assessment**: PARTIALLY PRESENT. "Agentic AI" appears on lines 188, 210, 212, and 214. "Security risks" appears separately. But the exact combined phrase "agentic AI security risks" never appears. The closest is line 210: "agentic AI assistant...minimal security controls." This phrase should appear at least once for searchers targeting this emerging query.

### Secondary keyword summary

| Keyword | Instances | Target | Status |
|---------|-----------|--------|--------|
| OpenClaw security | 0 | 2-3 | MISSING |
| ClawdBot vulnerabilities | 0 | 2-3 | MISSING |
| is ClawdBot safe | 1 | 1-2 | ADEQUATE |
| agentic AI security risks | 0 | 1-2 | MISSING |

## 5. Keyword stuffing risk assessment

### "ClawdBot" frequency analysis

**Total "ClawdBot" mentions in body**: ~32 instances (including headings and FAQ)

At ~2,800 words, that is roughly 1.1% density for the brand name alone. This is within acceptable range. The brand name is the subject of the article, so high frequency is expected and natural.

### Paragraph-level concentration check

| Section | "ClawdBot" count | Paragraphs | Density risk |
|---------|-------------------|------------|--------------|
| Intro (lines 19-23) | 4 | 2 | Slightly high but acceptable for intro |
| What is ClawdBot (lines 25-51) | 5 | 5 | Normal |
| Security risks (lines 53-102) | 6 | 8 | Normal |
| Supply chain (lines 104-114) | 1 | 3 | Low |
| Database breach (lines 116-130) | 2 | 4 | Low |
| Enterprise bans (lines 132-142) | 5 | 4 | Slightly high |
| Protection (lines 144-188) | 4 | 8 | Normal |
| FAQ (lines 190-206) | 5 | 5 | Normal |
| Key takeaways (lines 208-214) | 1 | 3 | Low |

**VERDICT**: NO STUFFING RISK. Distribution is natural. The brand name appears where it should contextually. No paragraph repeats "ClawdBot" more than twice, which reads naturally given it is the article subject.

```

**Heat map analysis**:
- **Hot zones** (high keyword concentration): Intro, enterprise bans section, FAQ
- **Cold zones** (low keyword concentration): RCE vulnerabilities section, supply chain section, database breach section
- **Primary keyword gaps**: The middle third of the article (lines 55-142) has only one instance of the exact primary keyword (line 53 H2). This creates a ~90-line gap before it reappears at line 144.
- **Secondary keyword desert**: No secondary keywords appear anywhere in the article body outside the frontmatter.

**Rationale**: Inserts the secondary keyword "ClawdBot vulnerabilities" into an H3 heading, improving ranking potential for that query while keeping the heading descriptive and natural.

---

### RECOMMENDATION 3: Add "OpenClaw security" to enterprise section (HIGH PRIORITY)

**Current text** (line 136):
> **Meta** banned OpenClaw from its corporate networks. Employees who use it on work laptops risk termination. **Gartner** described OpenClaw as carrying "unacceptable cybersecurity risk." **Palo Alto Networks** stated explicitly that "OpenClaw is not designed to be used in an enterprise ecosystem."

**Suggested revision**:
> **Meta** banned OpenClaw from its corporate networks. Employees who use it on work laptops risk termination. **Gartner** described OpenClaw security posture as carrying "unacceptable cybersecurity risk." **Palo Alto Networks** stated explicitly that "OpenClaw is not designed to be used in an enterprise ecosystem."

**Rationale**: Naturally inserts "OpenClaw security" as a secondary keyword by adding "posture" after it, which reads naturally in context.

---

---

### RECOMMENDATION 6: Add "ClawdBot vulnerabilities" to database breach section (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Current text** (line 130):
> This breach highlights a recurring pattern in the ClawdBot ecosystem. The vulnerabilities are not sophisticated. They reflect missing fundamental security controls, not cleverly bypassed ones.

**Suggested revision**:
> This breach highlights a recurring pattern in the ClawdBot ecosystem. The ClawdBot vulnerabilities discovered across its ecosystem are not sophisticated. They reflect missing fundamental security controls, not cleverly bypassed ones.

**Rationale**: Inserts "ClawdBot vulnerabilities" as a natural phrase in context. Fills the secondary keyword gap in the mid-article cold zone.

---

### RECOMMENDATION 7: Add primary keyword to supply chain section (MEDIUM PRIORITY)

**Current text** (line 104):
> ## How the ClawHavoc supply chain attack compromised thousands of users

Consider adding a sentence at the end of this section (after line 114) that references the primary keyword:

**Suggested addition after line 114**:
> The ClawHavoc campaign illustrates how ClawdBot security risks extend beyond the core application to its entire ecosystem of skills and extensions.

**Rationale**: Bridges the primary keyword gap in the mid-article cold zone (lines 53-144) and ties the supply chain narrative back to the article's primary theme.

---

### RECOMMENDATION 8: Strengthen "is ClawdBot safe" in FAQ answer (LOW PRIORITY)

**Current text** (line 194):
> In its default configuration, no. ClawdBot ships with authentication disabled, credentials stored in plaintext, and the service exposed to all network interfaces.

**Suggested revision**:
> In its default configuration, ClawdBot is not safe. It ships with authentication disabled, credentials stored in plaintext, and the service exposed to all network interfaces.

**Rationale**: Reinforces the question keyword "is ClawdBot safe" by echoing the phrase "ClawdBot is not safe" in the answer. This strengthens featured snippet potential for the question query.

---

### RECOMMENDATION 9: Add "ClawdBot vulnerabilities" to FAQ answer (LOW PRIORITY)

**Current text** (line 202):
> Yes. Multiple critical vulnerabilities have been demonstrated, including one-click remote code execution (CVE-2026-25253), Docker sandbox escapes, and SSH command injection.

**Suggested revision**:
> Yes. Multiple critical ClawdBot vulnerabilities have been demonstrated, including one-click remote code execution (CVE-2026-25253), Docker sandbox escapes, and SSH command injection.

**Rationale**: Inserts "ClawdBot vulnerabilities" one more time in a natural FAQ context, reaching the 2-3 instance target for this secondary keyword.

## 9. Notes

- The article has excellent topical authority signals through its deep LSI coverage (20+ semantic terms naturally integrated).
- The brand name "ClawdBot" appears frequently enough to establish clear topical relevance without stuffing.
- The primary weakness is in secondary keyword deployment. All four secondary keywords are effectively absent from the article body despite being listed in the frontmatter.
- The mid-article cold zone (supply chain, database breach, enterprise sections) would benefit from one or two primary keyword reinforcements to maintain keyword signal throughout the full article length.
- Meta elements (title, description, slug) are well-optimized and require no changes.
