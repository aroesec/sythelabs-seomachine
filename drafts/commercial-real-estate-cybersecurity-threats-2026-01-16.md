# Commercial real estate cybersecurity: why CRE companies are prime targets in 2025

Real estate-specific business email compromise attacks resulted in $446.1 million in losses in 2022 alone. That figure is seven times higher than all ransomware losses across every industry combined. Commercial real estate cybersecurity has become a critical concern as threat actors recognize the unique vulnerabilities in this sector.

The commercial real estate industry sits at a dangerous intersection. High-value transactions, complex multi-party ecosystems, and increasingly connected building systems create an attack surface that cybercriminals find irresistible. Yet 61% of real estate firms globally report having no dedicated cybersecurity team or policy.

This guide breaks down the specific threats facing commercial real estate operations, explains why building management systems represent an overlooked attack vector, and provides actionable steps to protect your properties and transactions. Whether you manage office buildings, retail centers, or industrial properties, understanding these risks is no longer optional.

## Why commercial real estate is a prime target for cybercriminals

Commercial real estate presents a unique combination of factors that make it exceptionally attractive to attackers. Understanding these factors is the first step toward building effective defenses.

### The complex ecosystem problem

A typical commercial real estate transaction or ongoing property operation involves numerous parties: property owners, tenants, property managers, contractors, subcontractors, service providers, lenders, title companies, and insurance providers. Each connection point represents a potential entry for attackers.

The high volume of field-to-office communication creates additional exposure. Workers in the field often connect to unsecured public networks to access and share company and client data. Many remain unaware they are putting sensitive information at risk.

Payment transactions flow constantly through this ecosystem. Large wire transfers for property purchases, lease payments, contractor invoices, and tenant deposits make real estate a playground for criminals deploying social engineering, phishing attacks, and wire fraud schemes.

### The data goldmine

Commercial real estate companies hold valuable data that attackers want:

- **Financial records**: Bank account details, wire transfer instructions, payment histories
- **Tenant information**: Personal and business data, social security numbers, financial statements
- **Building system credentials**: Access control systems, BMS passwords, network configurations
- **Proprietary business data**: Lease terms, property valuations, investment strategies
- **Transaction documents**: Purchase agreements, closing documents, loan information

A single breach can expose thousands of tenants and partners while providing everything needed for follow-on attacks and fraud.

### The industry maturity gap

The numbers reveal a sector that has underinvested in security:

- 61% of real estate firms globally have no dedicated cybersecurity team
- Only 27% perform regular vulnerability assessments or [penetration testing](https://sythelabs.com/services/penetration-testing)
- Just 9% of commercial real estate organizations have quantified their cyber exposure
- 40% lack an accurate inventory of their technology assets

This maturity gap exists while attackers increasingly target the sector. Real estate firms experienced a 38% year-over-year increase in ransomware attacks in 2024. The disconnect between threat escalation and defensive readiness creates significant risk.

## The top cybersecurity threats facing CRE in 2025

Four primary threat categories demand attention from commercial real estate security leaders. Each exploits specific characteristics of how the industry operates.

### Business email compromise: the $446 million threat

Business email compromise represents the single largest cybersecurity threat to real estate, yet many organizations focus their limited security resources elsewhere. The FBI reports that BEC losses with a real estate nexus reached $446.1 million in a single year.

BEC attacks in real estate typically follow a pattern:

1. Attackers compromise an email account belonging to someone involved in a transaction
2. They monitor communications to understand transaction details and relationships
3. At a critical moment, they insert fraudulent wire instructions
4. Funds transfer to attacker-controlled accounts before anyone realizes the deception

The emergence of AI-powered tools has supercharged these attacks. By mid-2024, an estimated 40% of BEC phishing emails were AI-generated. These messages can mimic the writing styles of trusted contacts, making fraudulent emails more convincing than ever. Deepfake technology now allows attackers to create realistic audio and video impersonations of executives or clients to manipulate financial transactions.

The statistics are sobering:

- 93% of title and escrow companies experienced phishing attacks in the past 12 months
- 17% of title companies sent client money to fraudulent accounts
- The median loss for wire fraud victims in real estate is $70,000
- BEC attack volume increased 1,760% year-over-year since generative AI tools became widely available

Recovery from BEC is uncertain. Legal liability typically falls on the entity in the best position to prevent the loss, which requires fact-specific analysis. The best recovery avenue involves quick reporting and coordination with law enforcement, but many victims never recover their funds.

### Ransomware targeting property operations

While BEC causes larger aggregate losses, ransomware can completely shut down property operations. One commercial real estate company in New York was locked out of its property management system, unable to monitor tenant payments, lease terms, or maintenance schedules. The attackers demanded a six-figure ransom in cryptocurrency.

Ransomware trends in real estate are concerning:

- 61% of ransomware attacks in construction and real estate successfully compromise backups
- Average recovery cost reaches $2.73 million (excluding ransom payment)
- Only 28% of organizations recover within one week
- Recovery times continue to lengthen as attacks grow more sophisticated

Attackers know that property operations cannot tolerate extended downtime. Tenants expect services. Transactions must close. This urgency increases pressure to pay ransoms, which in turn makes the sector more attractive for future attacks.

### Smart building and IoT vulnerabilities

Building management systems represent a growing and often overlooked attack surface. Historically, cybersecurity efforts focused on traditional IT infrastructure. The rapid expansion of IoT devices in building management, asset tracking, and site monitoring has introduced new vulnerabilities that many organizations have not addressed.

Smart buildings contain dozens, sometimes hundreds, of internet-connected devices with weak built-in security controls. Common vulnerabilities include:

- Wi-Fi networks with inadequate segmentation
- Wireless peripherals with default configurations
- Card-key access mechanisms
- HVAC control systems
- Power supply hardware
- Portfolio management software
- Elevator and escalator controls
- Fire suppression systems
- Parking management systems

These systems were never designed with cybersecurity in mind. They often run on software that has not been updated in years, leaving them vulnerable to known exploits. While IT environments typically benefit from mature security protocols and rigorous monitoring, BMS often lack the same protection.

The consequences of BMS compromise extend beyond data theft. Attackers who gain control of building systems can:

- Lock tenants out of facilities
- Manipulate HVAC to create uncomfortable or unsafe conditions
- Disable fire suppression or alarm systems
- Control elevator operations
- Access physical spaces through compromised access control

In healthcare facilities, BMS failures can compromise operating room climate control, infection prevention ventilation, and power delivery to medical equipment, directly threatening patient safety.

### Supply chain and third-party risks

Commercial real estate companies routinely collaborate with vendors, contractors, and service providers who may have weaker cyber controls. A major MLS system provider experienced a widespread cyberattack that disrupted real estate transactions across the country, locking out thousands of agents from their systems.

Third-party risk manifests in several ways:

- **Vendor access**: Service providers often have direct network access for maintenance and support
- **Shared credentials**: Contractors may share login credentials among multiple workers
- **Software dependencies**: Property management platforms rely on third-party integrations
- **Data sharing**: Transaction parties exchange sensitive documents through various channels

Major players including Fidelity National Financial and Mr. Cooper have been victims of breaches that stalled real estate closings for extended periods. These incidents demonstrate how a single vendor compromise can cascade across the industry.

## Building management systems: the overlooked attack surface

Building management systems deserve special attention because they combine high risk with low protection. Understanding BMS vulnerabilities helps prioritize defensive investments.

### Why BMS security matters

Modern BMS are deeply integrated with IT networks and increasingly internet-enabled. This integration exposes them to cyber threats that were once limited to traditional enterprise systems. A successful BMS attack can provide lateral movement into corporate networks while simultaneously affecting physical building operations.

The attack surface includes multiple entry points:

- Web interfaces for remote management
- Wireless connections for sensors and controls
- Third-party integrations with vendor systems
- Mobile applications for facilities management
- Cloud-based analytics platforms

Each connection point requires security consideration, yet many organizations do not know what systems they have. Forty percent of commercial real estate companies reported that having an accurate asset inventory was the most important capability they were missing that may have decreased the impact of cyberattacks.

### Common BMS vulnerabilities

Security assessments of building systems consistently reveal similar issues:

**Outdated software**: Many BMS run on legacy operating systems that no longer receive security updates. Patch management processes that work for IT systems often do not extend to operational technology.

**Insecure protocols**: Common OT communication protocols used in buildings include BACnet, Modbus, and KNX. These protocols have numerous vulnerabilities that can be exploited through denial-of-service or spoofing attacks. While the building industry is gradually adopting BACnet Secure Connect to improve network security, many legacy systems still use outdated protocols lacking encryption.

**Default credentials**: Building systems frequently retain manufacturer default passwords. Technicians may use shared credentials for convenience. Access controls may not enforce least-privilege principles.

**Inadequate network segmentation**: BMS connected directly to corporate networks enable attackers to move laterally between systems. A compromised building controller can become an entry point to business systems and data.

Addressing BMS security requires specialized assessment approaches. Standard IT vulnerability scans may not detect OT-specific issues. [Our security testing methodology](https://sythelabs.com/process) includes protocol-specific testing for building automation systems.

### Real-world impact scenarios

Consider what an attacker with BMS access could accomplish:

**Tenant disruption**: Manipulating HVAC systems during extreme weather to make spaces uncomfortable or unusable. Disabling elevators in high-rise buildings. Locking tenants out through compromised access control.

**Physical security breach**: Using access control compromise to enable unauthorized physical access. Disabling security cameras or alarms to cover other criminal activity.

**Safety system interference**: Disabling fire suppression or alarm systems. Manipulating emergency lighting. Interfering with life safety systems in ways that create genuine danger.

**Ransomware staging**: Using BMS access as a foothold to deploy ransomware across corporate networks. Encrypting both IT and OT systems simultaneously to maximize pressure for payment.

## How much does a CRE cyberattack actually cost?

Understanding the true cost of cyber incidents helps justify security investments. The numbers extend far beyond immediate losses.

### Direct financial losses

The most visible costs include:

- **Wire fraud losses**: Median loss of $70,000 per incident, with some reaching millions
- **Ransomware recovery**: Average $2.73 million excluding ransom payments
- **System restoration**: Hardware replacement, software reinstallation, data recovery
- **Investigation costs**: Forensic analysis, legal counsel, regulatory notifications
- **Business interruption**: Lost transactions, delayed closings, tenant credits

### Indirect costs

Less visible but equally significant costs affect long-term business health:

- **Reputational damage**: 36% of CRE respondents reported reputational harm from cyberattacks
- **Relationship losses**: 31% experienced loss of customer or partner relationships
- **Regulatory penalties**: Fines for data protection violations where applicable
- **Legal liability**: Lawsuits from affected tenants, transaction parties, or partners
- **Insurance increases**: Premium hikes following incidents, reduced coverage availability
- **Opportunity costs**: Management attention diverted from business operations

### The cost of inaction versus proactive security

A comprehensive security assessment for a mid-sized commercial real estate operation typically costs a small fraction of the average ransomware recovery. Regular penetration testing and vulnerability management represent an even smaller ongoing investment.

The calculation becomes clearer when considering that:

- 38% of CRE respondents reported financial losses from cyberattacks
- Insurance may not cover all losses, particularly those involving social engineering
- Reputational damage affects tenant retention and acquisition for years
- A single BEC incident can exceed the cost of years of proactive security investment

Organizations that view cybersecurity as a cost center rather than risk management often learn the true cost only after an incident.

## What should a CRE cybersecurity assessment include?

Commercial real estate operations require security assessments that address their unique environment. A thorough evaluation covers multiple dimensions.

### Network infrastructure testing

**External perimeter assessment**: Testing internet-facing systems for vulnerabilities that could allow unauthorized access. This includes web applications, VPN concentrators, email gateways, and any other systems exposed to the internet.

**Internal network security**: Once inside the network, how far can an attacker move? Internal testing evaluates segmentation, access controls, and the potential for lateral movement between systems.

**Wireless network evaluation**: Testing WiFi networks for unauthorized access points, weak encryption, and potential for eavesdropping. This is particularly important given the prevalence of mobile devices in property operations.

**Network segmentation verification**: Confirming that building systems, corporate networks, and tenant networks are properly isolated from each other.

### Application and web portal security

Property management software, tenant portals, and payment systems handle sensitive data and financial transactions. Testing should cover:

- Authentication and authorization controls
- Input validation and injection vulnerabilities
- Session management security
- API security for mobile and third-party integrations
- Payment processing security

### Building management system assessment

BMS testing requires specialized approaches:

- **Network isolation testing**: Verifying that building systems cannot reach corporate networks
- **Protocol security evaluation**: Testing BACnet, Modbus, and other OT protocols for vulnerabilities
- **Access control testing**: Evaluating authentication and authorization for building systems
- **IoT device security review**: Assessing the security of sensors, controllers, and other connected devices

### Social engineering and phishing assessment

Given the prevalence of BEC attacks, testing human defenses is essential:

- **Phishing simulations**: Realistic email campaigns that test employee awareness
- **Wire transfer procedure verification**: Attempting to modify payment instructions through social engineering
- **Physical security testing**: Attempting unauthorized facility access through social engineering

### Compliance alignment

Many CRE organizations must meet specific [compliance requirements](https://sythelabs.com/services/compliance-auditing):

- **SOC 2**: For organizations that provide services to other businesses
- **CMMC**: Required for organizations with U.S. Department of Defense contracts
- **State privacy laws**: Various state regulations governing personal data protection
- **Industry standards**: Requirements from investors, lenders, or business partners

A well-designed assessment maps findings to relevant compliance frameworks, helping prioritize remediation efforts.

## Protecting your commercial real estate operations

Moving from understanding threats to implementing defenses requires systematic action. Start with immediate steps, then build sustainable practices.

### Immediate actions

These steps address the most critical risks and can be implemented quickly:

**Implement multi-factor authentication**: MFA significantly reduces the risk of credential theft leading to unauthorized access. Prioritize email systems, property management software, and any system involved in financial transactions.

**Verify wire transfer procedures**: Establish out-of-band verification for all wire transfer requests. This means confirming wire instructions through a different communication channel than the request, such as calling a known phone number rather than one provided in an email.

**Segment BMS from corporate networks**: If building management systems are connected to corporate networks, implement network segmentation immediately. This limits the impact of a BMS compromise and prevents lateral movement.

**Conduct asset inventory**: You cannot protect what you do not know exists. Document all IT and OT systems, including building controls, IoT devices, and third-party connections.

### Ongoing security practices

Sustained security requires continuous effort:

**Regular penetration testing**: Annual [penetration testing](https://sythelabs.com/services/penetration-testing) at minimum, with more frequent testing for high-risk systems or after significant changes. Testing should cover both IT and OT environments.

**Employee security awareness training**: Regular training helps employees recognize phishing attempts and understand security procedures. Include specific scenarios relevant to real estate transactions.

**Vendor security assessments**: Evaluate the security practices of key vendors, particularly those with network access or who handle sensitive data. Include security requirements in contracts.

**Patch management**: Maintain current software across all systems, including building automation. Where patches cannot be applied, implement compensating controls.

### Building a security program

For organizations without dedicated security staff, consider these approaches:

**Dedicated security ownership**: Assign responsibility for security, even if the person has other duties. Someone must own the function for it to receive attention.

**Incident response planning**: Develop and test procedures for responding to security incidents. Know who to call, what to do, and how to communicate during a crisis.

**Cyber insurance evaluation**: Review coverage to understand what is and is not covered. Many policies exclude social engineering losses or have sublimits that may not cover actual incident costs.

**Third-party risk management**: Implement a process for evaluating and monitoring vendor security. This has become increasingly important as supply chain attacks proliferate.

## FAQ: commercial real estate cybersecurity

### How often should CRE companies conduct penetration testing?

At minimum, annual penetration testing is recommended. However, several situations warrant more frequent testing:

- After significant infrastructure changes
- Following a security incident
- When deploying new tenant-facing applications
- When regulatory requirements specify testing frequency
- When acquiring new properties with unknown security posture

Continuous vulnerability scanning between penetration tests helps identify new issues as they emerge.

### What compliance frameworks apply to commercial real estate?

The applicable frameworks depend on your specific situation:

- **SOC 2**: Relevant if you provide services to business tenants or process their data
- **HIPAA**: Required if you have healthcare tenants and access to protected health information
- **PCI DSS**: Applicable if you process credit card payments directly
- **State privacy laws**: Various state regulations may apply based on where you operate and whose data you hold
- **CMMC**: Required for organizations contracting with the U.S. Department of Defense

Many CRE organizations also face contractual security requirements from investors, lenders, or large tenants.

### How do you secure building management systems?

Effective BMS security requires multiple layers:

1. **Network segmentation**: Isolate BMS from corporate and tenant networks
2. **Access control**: Implement strong authentication and limit access to authorized personnel
3. **Monitoring**: Log and monitor BMS activity for anomalies
4. **Patch management**: Keep systems updated where possible; implement compensating controls where not
5. **Vendor management**: Control and monitor third-party access to building systems
6. **Security assessment**: Test BMS security using appropriate OT-aware methodologies

### What are the signs of a business email compromise attempt?

Watch for these warning signs:

- Unexpected changes to wire transfer instructions
- Urgency or pressure to complete transactions quickly
- Requests to keep transactions confidential
- Slight variations in email addresses or domains
- Communications at unusual times or in unusual styles
- Requests that bypass normal procedures

When in doubt, verify through a different communication channel using contact information you already have on file.

## Conclusion

Commercial real estate faces a unique threat environment. The combination of high-value transactions, complex multi-party ecosystems, connected building systems, and relatively low security maturity creates attractive targets for cybercriminals. BEC losses alone exceed $446 million annually, and the emergence of AI-powered attacks is accelerating the threat.

The good news is that effective defenses exist. Organizations that implement strong authentication, verify wire transfer procedures, segment their networks, and conduct regular security assessments significantly reduce their risk. Proactive security investment costs a fraction of breach recovery.

The organizations that thrive will be those that recognize cybersecurity as a business necessity rather than an IT problem. They will build security into their operations, assess their vendors, and maintain vigilance against evolving threats.
